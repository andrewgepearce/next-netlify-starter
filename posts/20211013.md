### AGM survey

This year, we have followed the same format as last year providing links to our submissions on Council planning applications and an online survey (see
this survey at [https://www.survio.com](https://www.survio.com/survey/d/E3D6Q7X4O1O7N7K2R). To complete the business of the AGM we ask residents to
complete this survey, in which we also hope that residents will leave any feedback for the committee.
